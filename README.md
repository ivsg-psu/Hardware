# ROS install instructions
<details close>
<summary> Click to see/unsee </summary>

<h2> Versions </h2>
As of 01/2021, the team is switching systems from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with ROS Kinketic, to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and ROS Melodic. We're keeping an eye on ROS 2.0 but do not suggest yet that anyone jump into this for project-critical work.

### Install instructions for PCs
1. Begin by downloading the Ubuntu ISO file [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04.4/)

--Note-- 
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is available [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop), but 20.04 is not currently used on a group-wide basis

2. There are two options for installing Ubuntu: via [DVD](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/burn-a-dvd-on-windows#1-overview) or via [USB](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)

Instructions for either DVD install or USB install can be found at the links provided above which redirect you to an Ubuntu.com tutorial.

3. Once a bootable DVD or USB has been created, follow [this](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) installation tutorial

4. Once Ubuntu has successfully been installed, the following instructions from [wiki.ros.org](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) can be used to download ROS melodic.

5. After completing the installation instructions from wiki.ros.org, you have successfully installed ROS melodic!

Supplemental Video Instruction:

The following [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6GDonGFHw&t=6s) takes you to a youtube guide that provides an introduction to ROS as well as a video run through of the installation process. 

--Note--
This video is a bit dated and runs through the installation process for ROS jade, but the process for installing jade and melodic is very similar

# Real-time control architectures
<details close>
<summary> Click to see/unsee </summary>

The group requires real-time performance in many systems (see for example, the work in the Driving Simulator area of this Wiki). There are some good articles on this topic, including topics on:

The XBot Real-Time Software:
* [L. Muratore, A. Laurenzi, E. Mingo Hoffman and N. Tsagarakis, "The XBot Real-Time Software Framework for Robotics: From the Developer to the User Perspective," in IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, doi: 10.1109/MRA.2020.2979954](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9059019)

A key challenge in deciding between architectures to use is ease of use - which leans toward MATLAB and Simulink implementations with Arduino's, versus performance - which leans toward ROS with dedicated real-time platforms and hardware such as GPUs, DSPs, and real-time operating systems. In the past, various members of the group have use a variety of solutions, and their success or failure is useful to study to understand these tradeoffs.

## ROS-based implementations
Most of the PhD students in the team use Robot Operating System.

### Common ROS implementations
The most basic ROS implementation with hardware is to use single or multiple Arduinos, or similar hardware interface devices, to collect data in pseudo-real-time. Pseudo real-time is limited by the time-keeping on the ROS master, which is usually within about 10 ms but is known to delay up to 200 or more ms. Thus, this protocol is useful for simplistic data collection but not for real-time control of systems of bandwidth of 1 Hz or faster. As most of the motor-control and even vehicle position-control systems within the team require faster than 1 Hz plant control, this ROS system approach is not suited for most of the feedback control implementations within the team.

However, it is common that many hardware systems - even Arduinos - can have their hardware-based data collection triggered by a hard real-time source, such as the PPS signal of nearly any GPS device (or up-sampled versions of the same). In this case, ROS is simply acting as a data aggregation service overlaid on the "hard" real-time behavior imposed by the trigger. This is the common method of collecting data, such as is used in the team's mapping van.

### Advanced ROS implementations
More recently, Jesse Pentzer (now with ARL) has been studying the use of ROS 2.0 with DDS (Data Distribution Service - for more information, see [here](https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_on_dds.html)). The DDS format allows a master-less data-sharing, such that topic discovery for the publish-subscribe process, is distributed rather than coordinated through a central ROS master. 

Jesse's hardware solution for the above is to use a ruggedized fan-less PC computer onboard a robot. Real-time motor control is achieved in the motor controller itself via Roboteq controllers. Jesse has also lately (2020 to 2021) been examining the use of Robotics Technology Kernal (RTK).

# Real-time Control Software
<details close>
<summary> Click to see/unsee </summary>

Real-time operating systems guarantee system performance within a given time interval. A [discussion by NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/482489main_4100_-_RTOS_101.pdf) is useful to understand how these relate to safety and performance. A discussion of RTOSs can be found related to (NASA, here)[https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-Real-Time-Operating-Systems-RTOS-that-NASA-has-used-and-why]. The evolution of RTOS is explained in a neat article by ARSTechnica [here](https://arstechnica.com/features/2020/10/the-space-operating-systems-booting-up-where-no-one-has-gone-before/), which explains VxWorks and the recent open-source movement toward RTEMS.

## Strict practices for real-time control implementations

* [Read the rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code](http://pixelscommander.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/P10.pdf) These rules are common practice used in the team, and violating these practices nearly always results in frustration or code breakage later. Learn and follow these rules.


### Learn more

There are wonderful code tools available open-source in [NASA's Code repository](https://code.nasa.gov/?q=real-time). This is a good location to browse for examples and very powerful code tools.
